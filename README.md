Pyber Analysis

Over viewing of the analysis	
	The beginning of the analysis our focus was to help improve the affordability for under serve neighborhood. With the new job that she gave us, she wants Omar and I to create a data frame that will analysis the data by the cities. City such as Rural, Suburban and Urban. Had to use the groupby, count and sum function to fine the total rides, total drivers, and total fare. Had to find the average of the fare as well the average of per ride. Gathering that information we were able to do the rest of the work.


One of the charts that was created.



In here we can see the information we gather with using the group, sum count function with the average of the information. We can see Urban has more rides and well as more drivers. You can also see that Rural  has less drivers but they average fare is more higher than the other two cites.

We might have not looked into more cities but with the one that we got we are able to get a little concept of the average week to week fare. We can see that Rural prices are more high because they are fewer drivers.
